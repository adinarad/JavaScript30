This repository includes my solutions for the 30 Days JavaScript challenge. These may differ from the original solutions as I tried to incorporate some 'best practices' or 
just to enhance the UI.

## About
Challenge involves building 30 things in 30 days using *Vanilla JavaScript* (No Frameworks or Libraries):computer:.

Before taking up the challenge you should have a decent grasp of JavaScript fundamentals, comfort working with functions, callbacks, arrays, and objects. If not, 
you can still learn it on the fly. It might take you more time completing the challenge, but it would be worth the effort.

*Well if it can be done with a JS library, it can (probably) be done with Vanilla JS.* 

JavaScript30 is an excellent learning resource. Take up the challenge. All the best:v:.
